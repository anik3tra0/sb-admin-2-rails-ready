This is a bare bones Rails 4 project that uses the [SB Admin 2](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin-2/) Bootstrap 3 theme. It's a nice looking static dashboard style interface. 

This is a quick way to get a rails app with a dashboard up and running. Just clone and bundle install. You can download the SB Admin 2 Theme for documentation on how to use it's features.

Font-awesome is used as well.
